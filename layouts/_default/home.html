                                    <p>Co-design is an approach to designing artifacts and experiences that reflect the
                                        lived experiences, practices, and goals of participants through their inclusion
                                        and
                                        active participation throughout the design process. <span class="orange fw7">One
                                            recurring problem in
                                            co-design, however, is that traditionally participants have little to no say
                                            over
                                            the materials they use while designing.</span> </p>
                                    <p>Often, these materials (e.g.,
                                        markers,
                                        colored sticky notes, tablets, microcontrollers, etc.) are imposed on
                                        participants,
                                        which may not be relevant or useful to their goals or contexts. Past research
                                        has
                                        also shown how participants may sometimes prefer to draw on their own tangible
                                        or
                                        intangible materials in co-design. Given the important role that materials play
                                        in
                                        co-design, <span class="orange fw7">what happens when we shift control of design
                                            materials to participants?</span></p>
